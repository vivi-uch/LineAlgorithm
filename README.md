## Introduction
In this project, I developed a web-based application that allows users to draw lines using three different line drawing algorithms: DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer), Bresenham, and Midpoint algorithms. The application provides a visual representation of the points between two points known as the starting and ending points.

## Features
- Implementation of DDA, Bresenham, and Midpoint line drawing algorithms.
- Interactive interface for users to input line starting and Endiing coordinates.
- Visual representation of the possible points in a table,
- Clear and concise user interface design.

## Implementation Details
- **HTML:** Contains the structure of the web application, including input fields for coordinates and the canvas element for drawing lines.
- **CSS:** Styles the HTML elements to provide a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the logic for the DDA, Bresenham, and Midpoint line drawing algorithms.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/vivi-uch/LineAlgorithm.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd LineAlgorithm`

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Input the coordinates for the line you want to draw.
3. Select the algorithm (DDA, Bresenham, or Midpoint) you want to use.
4. Recieve the outputs in a table representation.
